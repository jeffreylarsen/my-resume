    <h3>Pinball</h3>
    <p>As much as I have enjoyed playing video games in my life, nothing matches the fun I enjoy when I play Pinball! I currently play in leagues and tournaments where I've met some amazing people who also have the silver ball addiction.</p>
    <p>My favorite game is Attack from Mars! (Pictured on the right) It's what got me into this mess!</p>

    <h3>Arts & Music</h3>
        <p>I always have headphones on. Music is a big part of my life. I enjoy listening to and even playing music! It is something that brings us all together. I like to play the piano, guitar, ukulele, and also sing!</p>
        <p>I recently also started to paint! I started in VR, just following some Bob Ross tutorials and loved the creative outlet it provided. Using the techniques I practiced virtually, translated pretty well to the real thing! It's not something I have done a lot, but hope to have more of in my life.</p>

    <h3>Reading</h3>
        <p>I did not like reading as a kid. I always saw it as a chore to get through a book. Now as an adult, I read mostly self improvement types of books. Your "How to Win Friends and Infulence People"s and "Atomic Habits" kind of books. They hold so much good information and insight. I wish I gave just a half more of a crap, when I was in school. Not to be a good little student, but to absorb and be the best I could be. There is so much to learn and appriciate in this life.</p>
        <p>My Favorite books I've read are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How to Win Friends and Infulence People - Dale Carnegie</li>
            <li>Rich Dad, Poor Dad - Robert T. Kiyosaki</li>
            <li>The Richest Man in Babylon - George Samuel Clason</li>
            <li>12 Rules for Life - Jordan B. Peterson</li>
            <li>[Currently Reading] Atomic Habits - James Clear</li>
        </ul>
